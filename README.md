## Welcome to AgileZenExporter

AgileZenExporter is a web application written in Ruby on Rails, to export stories to a .XLSX (Microsoft Excel 2007), given a projectId and a generated ApiKey, through a API exposed by AgileZen.

I've uploaded this for educational purposes only.  It's simple, and you can use it as an example.

It uses Rails 3.2, axlsx gem, and agilezen gem.
